The automation lifecycle is a phased approach for implementing and scaling automation enterprise-wide:

- In Discover, the focus is on defining process governance and using data to pick the right processes for automation. Automation opportunities are identified by the employees or by AI-powered technologies.
- In the Build phase, there are automation solutions that cater to:
  - Professional automation developers - offering powerful development and debugging tools, advanced integrations, as well as world-class UI automation capabilities.
  - Business Users - rapidly automating their business apps without the need for developer resources or coding skills.
- The Management capabilities help test, deploy, manage and optimize the performance of the robot fleet and of the AI capabilities.
- Running robots has to offer flexibility, matching the types of processes automated, the type of human-robot collaboration, and the existing setup.
- Engagement between human users and the robots happens in a simple manner, whenever it is needed.
