The input fields in the form above are a subset of the fields in uploading a fresh ML Package with the addition of a Change Log field. The Change Log field is intended to allow users to communicate context about a change to another user of the application.

When a new ML Package Version is uploaded on an existing ML Package, that creates a new Major Version. For example, if I have uploaded my first ML Package, that upload will be version 1.0. When I upload a new version, that version will be 2.0.
