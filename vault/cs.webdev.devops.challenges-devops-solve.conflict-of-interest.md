![Conflict of interest](/assets/images/2022-06-17-12-47-18.png)

Both developers and Operations team have different incentives. The developers need to code the features fast without thinking about stability while the operations team are incentivised by maintaining the stability and performance of the application. As they don't understand how the code is written or how the applications function, they try to slow down the incoming changes as they need to check if there are errors or if the new feature breaks something which again leads to slower release process.

The common goal of the team is to deliver high-quality applications to end-users fast. So the developers and the operations team have to compromise with their job incentives to make sure the common goal is reached. This leads to a conflict of interest.
