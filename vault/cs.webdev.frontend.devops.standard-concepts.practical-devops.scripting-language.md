In order for DevOps to work closely with the developers and system administrator as well as automatic tasks for development and deployment, the DevOps engineer needs to know a programming or a scripting language to code scripts for creating backups, system monitoring, cron jobs, network management etc.

Some of the examples of scripting languages are:

1. OS Dependent: Bash for Linux or Powershell for Windows
2. OS Independent and more powerful: Python (most popular and in demand), Ruby, Golang etc.

This same infrastructure as code can be then stored in a code repository like the application code.
