## RPA

- Traditional RPA has already proven immense business values as the technology has enabled customers to automate rule-based, repetitive tasks throughout an organization. However, there are still many high-value use cases that cannot be tackled by traditional RPA.
- We want to take RPA to the next level by integrating AI into automations. This will enable robots to do more sophisticated automations and complete cognitive tasks, such as classifying emails and predicting sales.

## AI

- Data
  - Spend IDC: Spending on AI systems is expected to reach $97.9 Billion in 2023, but only 4% of CIOs have implemented AI as of 2018
  - AI-powered organization Accenture: Yet, 76% of enterprises struggle to scale from pilot
- The combination of RPA+AI creates a broader set of problems to be solved.

## RPA + AI

- When conceptualizing RPA and AI, it can be helpful to think of AI as the brain, and RPA as the hands. A disconnected brain can dream up concepts, but without hands it can’t apply them. At the same time, hands without a brain can’t handle advanced processes. It's when the two are combined that complex tasks can be completed.
- Data Scientists can build models for supervised or unsupervised tasks (that may or may not involve deep learning techniques) and easily make them accessible in the business context they are needed in, thus enabling more sophisticated automations, such as classifying emails or predicting next quarter sales.
- It is important to note that Machine Learning systems require moderate to very large amounts of data to reach production-level quality, thus a first step in automating an ML-enabled use case may be gathering enough data to train the model.
