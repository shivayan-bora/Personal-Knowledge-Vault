The first step to learning anything new is to make connections or associations between new information and what you already know. This is called learning through association.

Ways of learning through association:

1. Compare and Contrast: Compare the similarities and the differences between concepts.
2. Part and Whole: Breakdown a big idea into some medium ideas and further break it down in small and basic ideas.

To breakdown concepts, we can use the T-Tree framework.

Example: If you take a look at the book of contents of a textbook, the underlying structure might look like this:

When structuring information, the relationship between different ideas i.e. branches/twigs is more important than the details of the ideas i.e. leaves.

The T-Tree framework borrows it's structure from a textbook, however, if you want to have some structure of your own, then use Mind Maps.

To structure your knowledge better, make meaningful notes and try to make it more visual as it's said, `a picture is worth a 1000 words`.

Tips:

1. Structure the information in your own words.
2. Use less words.
3. Group ideas together.
4. Use more pictures and visuals.
5. Practice.
