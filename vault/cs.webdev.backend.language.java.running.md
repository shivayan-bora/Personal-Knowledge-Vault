1. First we will write the source code which is a high-level code that's not understood by the computer.
2. Then we will use a `javac` compiler to compile our code into byte-code.
3. This byte-code can be used by JVM's to execute the code. This byte-code gets converted into 0's and 1's for the computer to understand.
