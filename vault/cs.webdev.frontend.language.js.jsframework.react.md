React is a JavaScript Library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded.

In React, we always need to remember that the DOM is the only way to interact with the user. React is a library that abstracts away the DOM from us, so we can focus on the business logic.
