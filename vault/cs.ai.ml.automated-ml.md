- Automated Machine Learning is the process of automating all, or portions, of the machine learning life cycle. In a typical process, data scientists may need to handle data-preprocessing, feature engineering, feature extraction, feature selection, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization. In an automated machine learning scheme, any of these steps may be fully or partially automated.
  - Automated ML algorithms incorporate best practices of top-ranked data scientists to create models and blueprints.
- Automated Machine Learning increases the accessibility of machine learning throughout an organization since it allows non-experts to create machine learning models with the help of these tools
- H2O.ai is a UiPath technology partner that has offerings for automated machine learning. A H2O model can be easily deployed on [[cs.ai.ml.rpa.enhanced-rpa.uipath.products.ai-center]].
