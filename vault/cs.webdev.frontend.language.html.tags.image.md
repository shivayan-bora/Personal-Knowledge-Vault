It's a self closing tag and an inline element to put images into it. You can specify the width and height of an image directly into the HTML tag but it's not a good standard to do it that way. It's better to use CSS for this purpose.

```html
<img src='<some-img-url>' alt="<some-alternate-text-to-display-if-image-can't-be-loaded>"/>
```
