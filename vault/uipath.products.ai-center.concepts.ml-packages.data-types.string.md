Any data that can be serialized can be used with an ML Package. If used within an RPA workflow, the data can be serialized by the Robot (perhaps using a custom Activity) and sent as a string. If used externally from UiPath, the data can be formatted and serialized by the client. In both of these cases, the ML Package uploader would have selected json as the ML Packageâ€™s input type.

The deserialization of data is done in the predict function. Below are a handful of examples for deserializing data in Python:
