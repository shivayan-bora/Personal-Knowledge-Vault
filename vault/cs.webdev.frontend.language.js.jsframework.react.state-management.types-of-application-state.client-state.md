This is the state that's only useful for the UI to control the interactivity of different parts of the application e.g. `isOpen` property of a modal which is used to check if a modal is open or not or if the theme is in light mode or dark mode.

Properties of Client state:

1. It's Ephemeral i.e. it gets lost when the browser is refreshed or closed.

2. Synchronous i.e. it's readily available.

3. Client Owned i.e. it's local to the browser that created it.
