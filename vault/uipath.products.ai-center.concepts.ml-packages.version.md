When an ML Package is uploaded, this will be shown a version 1.0 of that ML Package (we say this is Major Version 1, and Minor Version 0). This is to differentiate between ML Packages that have been uploaded by the user, and ML Packages that have been retrained via Pipelines (these will only change Minor Version).
