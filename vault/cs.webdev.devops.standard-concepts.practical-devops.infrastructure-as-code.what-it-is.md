IaC is a way to automate all DevOps tasks end-to-end where you leverage the knowledge of System Administrator and Operations to create programs or applications to achieve that.

IaC is a concept and you use IaC tools like Terraform, Ansible, Puppet etc. to perform those tasks.

There's no one tool that can do everything and each one of them is good in only one specific area.
