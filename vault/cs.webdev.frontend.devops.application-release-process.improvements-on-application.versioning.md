For adding improvements on your application you will mostly do software versioning.

Usually, the modern day versioning is done with three numbers e.g. the current most stable version of node.js is `v16.15.1`.

The first part is the major version, which consists of changes to the entire framework for coding.

The second part is minor version, which consists of updates to one small feature.

The third part is the patch version, which consists of quick small changes or bug fixes.
