These days most of the containers are deployed on cloud based servers rather than on-premise servers. There are plenty of cloud service providers like AWS, Azure, GCP etc. This is called infrastructure as a service.

Some of the benefits include:

1. Lower costs
2. Offer a variety of services

However, most of the cloud providers have their own services and the way we use them is different as well. Hence it's better to pick one service up like AWS and then use it for our own needs. It's not necessary to learn all the service offerings of all the cloud providers. You only need to learn the services you need.
