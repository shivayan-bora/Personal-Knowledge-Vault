The main miscommunication might happen between developers and operations where both of them have different responsibilities.

The developers are responsible for coding the application, but they aren't aware on how to deploy and run the application, so, they code without considering where the application gets deployed.

The operations team have the responsibility of deploying and operating the application but, they don't know how the application works, so, they don't know what and why they're deploying or how the application works.

This may lead to miscommunication and lack of collaboration which may lead to the following problems:

1. The developers finish coding but the deployement guide isn't well documented enough. The operations team might struggle deploying it and it slows down the release process.

2. The feature gets implemented but can't be deployed because the application has issues and doesn't work properly because of which the operation team throws back the code to the developers suggesting improvements which can stretch the release period for days, weeks or months again slow down the release process.

3. There's no clearly defined automated process of handover between developers and operations. It's based on a complex bureaucratic processes of what checklist need to be completed, what needs to be documented and who needs to manually approve what for the release to progress.
