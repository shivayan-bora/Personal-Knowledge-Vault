We now have two separate parts of the release process. One part is the development where developers will create code changes to a new feature and push the changes in the repository.

The next part is the operations which includes servers where your application changes will get hosted for the end users to use which is maintained by the Operations teams.

The question now arises, on how we actually release the application continuously and in an automated, efficient and fast manner?

This is where Devops comes in as they deal with this while making sure the CI/CD principles are taken care of and the release happens in an automated fashion.
