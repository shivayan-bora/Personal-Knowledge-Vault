Once the automated process is built and tested, developers publish it to Orchestrator, and from there they can deploy it to user's machines. It's a tool to monitor, optimize and secure your robot workforce.

Orchestrator also provides various triggers to run the automation e.g. time, schedule or number of items in queue etc. This is called unattended automation and it runs on VM's.
