RPA is the technology that allows computer software to mimic actions, typically performed by human beings. The computer software that executes the operations is called a Robot. RPA robots can do a lot of things:

1. Extracting structured data from a document.
2. Signing into and running applications.
3. Opening emails and attachments.
4. Filling out forms.
5. Reading and writing to databases.
6. Make calculations.
7. Connect to other systems.

Basically RPA enabled humans to have more time to create and less-to-no effort invested in tedious tasks.
