A DevOps engineer should know the basics of network and security. These include:

1. Firewall, proxy servers
2. Load balancers to balance the load in case of multiple servers
3. HTTP/HTTPS to make your application available to the end user
4. IP, Ports, DNS name resolutoion, how they works

DevOps engineers just need to know the basics as their only requirement is to be able to deploy the application and maintain it's stability. There are other specialized roles who handle the tasks in these areas, who have an indepth knowledge on the topic e.g. System, Network and Security Administrators etc.
