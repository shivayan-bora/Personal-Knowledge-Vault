Deep learning is a class of algorithms that uses many layers to learn a task (whether supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised or under another scheme). Each layer can be thought of as transformation from input to intermediate outputs. The numerous layers allow for the algorithms to encode data in very complex ways. Some of these algorithms can be thought of as progressively transforming input data into something more composite and complex.

Example: A deep learning algorithms that analyzes an image may have the lower layers identify edges, while the higher layers may identify the features relevant to a human such as text or faces.
