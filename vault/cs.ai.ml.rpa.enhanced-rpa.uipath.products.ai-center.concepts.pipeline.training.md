A Training Pipeline is used to train a new machine learning model. To use this pipeline the ML Package must contain code to train a model (the `train()` function in `train.py`) and code to persist a newly trained model (the `save()` function in `train.py`), these together with a Dataset (or sub-folder within a Dataset) produce a new ML Package Version.
