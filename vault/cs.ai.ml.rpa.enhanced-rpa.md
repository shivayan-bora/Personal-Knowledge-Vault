It entails the following features:

- AI Skills:
NLP, Intelligent OCR, AI Computer vision can enable robots to take over tasks they weren't able to do before. Processing handwritten texts, digital images and analysing text sentiments are tasks our robots can easily perform.

- ML:
ML capabilities allow robots to learn from the automation work that they do in order to further improve themselves.

- Native integrations:
These allow you to build robots that work with applications you might already use in your day-to-day activities.

- Long-running workflows:
With support for long running workflows, we can now tackle more diverse and valuable business scenarios. e.g. imagine a process that needs approval from a manager. The robot will keep on running in a loop and waiting until the manager provides an approval. Now that same robot can be put on to other automations and when the manager provides an approval, another robot can be assigned the approval automation to continue that process. When you have a finite pool of robots, it's important to orchestrate the automations in a smart manner, so that every robot is used to the maximum potential.

- Process Mining:
This ensures that we go for the processes that bring a lot of value when they're automated. It works by analysing the digital footprints left behind in systems and applications. Then, it turns that raw data into intuitive process graphs and dashboards to help users discover, automate and monitor processes continuously.

- Advanced Analtyics:
Measuring data is eesential and organizations make a habit of measuring ROI and RPA is no exception to it. With the right measurement tools, RPA can become a better platform for companies.
