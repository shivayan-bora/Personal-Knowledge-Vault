The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, is another way to represent colors.

The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

If you imagine the [[cs.webdev.frontend.language.css.colour-theory.colour-wheel]], the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.

Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.
