Once we have multiple containers running on Kubernetes clusters in various servers, we need to be able to monitor the stability and the performance of the application. Apart from that we need to be able to see if the users are facing any bottlenecks or any errors.

For this we need to use a monitoring tool like Prometheus or Nagios etc. to monitor the software and it's underlying infrastructure.
