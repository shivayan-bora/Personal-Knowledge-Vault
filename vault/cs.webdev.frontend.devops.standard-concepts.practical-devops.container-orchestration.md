These days almost all the applications are being run as containers as almost all companies are using docker images these days.

For smaller applications, we can use Docker compose to manage the containers.

However, for managing containers of larger applications consisting of multiple microservices, we need something powerful like [[Kubernetes|cs.webdev.frontend.devops.tools.kubernetes]]. So a DevOps engineer needs to learn Kubernetes works and be able to administer, manage the cluster as well as deploy applications in it.
