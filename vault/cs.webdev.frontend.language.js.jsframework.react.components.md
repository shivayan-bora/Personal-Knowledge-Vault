In React we create components. Components are self-contained pieces of UI that only re-render when their props change.

We can think of the components or in general UI as a function of the state and props.

You can use `div`, `span` etc. HTML tags to create components or create a custom component that contains a bunch of other React elements composed together to form a single component that can be reused anywhere.
