The main goal of application release process is to deliver your application to the end user.

The Typical Application Release process looks like the following:

1. You have an idea for an application.
2. You gather the requirements.
3. You code the application.
4. You then test the application.
5. You build and package the source code into some executable that can be used to run your application.
6. After this you will prepare and configure a server with all the tools needed for your application.
7. Then you will deploy the application executable on the server.
8. You will configure the firewall for security.

Then your application is launched and the end users can start using your application.

Even after your application is deployed, the application development doesn't stop there. We need to constantly monitor:

1. If there's any problem with the application?
2. Are the end users facing any issues due to bugs etc.?
3. Can the application handle high user load.
