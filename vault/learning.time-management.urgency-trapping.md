Our brains are quite incapable of prioritizing tasks on a regular basis for the modern day mostly for medium to long term.

We always prioritize tasks that are urgent and that might not be the best case scenario. e.g. in college and schools we used to get homeworks and they always have a time limit. However, prioritizing homework over quality studying is not always the best case scenatio. In fact, research suggests, too much homework can be harmful to grades.

Something like learning 15 minutes everyday on learning techniques is not something our brain considers urgent, but, that can be very important in the long term as it can save a lot of time and effort.

To combat urgency trapping, we need to schedule things that're important first, rather than the urgent ones.
