There are a couple of key differences between block-level elements and [[cs.webdev.frontend.language.html.element.inline]]:

- **Content model**
Generally, block-level elements may contain inline elements and (sometimes) other block-level elements. Inherent in this structural distinction is the idea that block elements create "larger" structures than inline elements.

- **Default formatting**
By default, block-level elements begin on new lines, but inline elements can start anywhere in a line.
