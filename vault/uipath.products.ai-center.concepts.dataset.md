A Dataset is a folder of storage. The folder can have arbitrary sub-folders and files. The purpose of having a Dataset is to allow machine learning models in your project to access new data points (either new files or folders uploaded from the application, or data from UiPath Robots at runtime).

A dataset can be created from scratch or by uploading a folder.

A Dataset can be explored just like a file system. You can select a folder to view the contents of that folder.

Files can be downloaded or deleted by selecting the 3-dot menu. Download of folders is not yet supported.

Multiple files or folders can be deleted by selecting multiple checkboxes (multiple download is not available yet).

In addition, a file or sub-folder can be uploaded at any depth in the Dataset.
