It's a superset of JavaScript. JavaScript by defualt is dynamically typed. But TypeScript allows us to specify static types during compile time.

However, this is not pure JavaScript i.e. the browser can't understand this syntax. For this, you might need a transpiler like [[cs.webdev.frontend.language.js.tools.babel]].
