Algorithms uncover insights, patterns, and relationships from a labeled training data set. The algorithms are able to learn how the features relate to the target and make predictions on future data.

- Classification: label each example by choosing between 2 or more different classes.
  - Example: Will a person default on a loan? Yes or no?
  - Example: classifying emails "spam" or "not spam"
- Regression: an algorithm returns a numerical target
  - Example: Predicting the price of a home based on features like square footage, zip code, etc...
