The end goal of any application development cycle is to make your code available to the end users. Once you have coded your application and pushed it into a `git` repository, you need to deploy your application into a server which can host your application for the end users to use it.

You may use either an on-premise server or a cloud service to deploy your application. In each of these two, the DevOps engineer needs to install the dependencies and prepare the infrastucture for the server to be able to run your code. Most of the servers run on Linux Based operating systems.

To be able to effectively use these servers, the DevOps engineer needs to know about:

1. Linux basics
2. CLI
3. Shell commands
4. Linux file system
5. Server management
6. SSH key management
