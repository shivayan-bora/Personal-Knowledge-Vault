### 1.Development

The first step is development which consists of developers coding the feature and pusing the code into a code repository like [[git|cs.webdev.frontend.devops.tools.git]]. Although theDevOps engineer is not supposed to code, they need to be aware of how the developers work, which git workflow they're using and also how the application is configured to talk with various services and databases as well as concepts of automated testing.
