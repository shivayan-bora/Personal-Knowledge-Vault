With the power of CSS, we can convert any element to look like any other element. e.g. we can create `div`'s from a `button` or a `button` from a `div`. Also, we have multiple header elements like `h1`, `h2` etc. however, any header can be made to look like any other header with CSS. As a matter of fact, we can convert the entire HTML document to just consist of `div`'s and change the styling to visually make them look like the other elements.

Visually we can see all the different elements and understand what it is, however, it's necessary for our code to understand that too. HTML by nature was meant to define a Semantic structure of the webpage which is used for accessibility purposes. When we use different tags, screen readers and other accessibility readers which might be used by a disabled person, will give them a better User Experience in navigating through the website e.g. `h1` will them what the website is and different headings will tell them what's important in decreasing level of importance. Similarly, `button` will them that there's a button there which can be clicked, etc.
