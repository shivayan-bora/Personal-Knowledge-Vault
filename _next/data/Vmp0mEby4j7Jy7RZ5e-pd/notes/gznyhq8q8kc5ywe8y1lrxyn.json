This continuous cycle of being highly motivated and being productive and then later falling into a slup and then again reigniting the motivation continuously is not sustainable and may lead to burnout.</p>\n<p>Many people deal with procrastination in incorrect ways with solutions that are unsustainable. People attribute their procrastination to low levels of motivation, then get trapped in a cycle of being motivated and unmotivated, which puts goals at risk when the unmotivated cycle inevitably becomes prolonged and you “burn out”.</p>\n<p>The problem with this entire system of productivity is relying on motivation. Motivation is a very fickle thing. It can be easily lost and it can be easily regained. It is not a reliable source of energy. It is not a reliable source of productivity. It is not a reliable source of consistency.</p>\n<p>Motivation is extremely multifactorial. Lots of factors make up motivation. Each of these factors go up and down on a daily basis. We often don't make plans on what we need to do when we are not motivated.</p>\n<p>Instead of planning on tasks that need high necessary motivation, we can plan tasks that need low motivation, are easy, realistic and we can even do on our bad days. This way we can be productive and consistent even when we are not motivated.</p>\n<p>Consistency is much more important than bursts. Consistency builds habit and the motivation needed to do it becomes lower. Habits can become on autopilot. You don't procrastinate on something that's a habit, you procrastinate on something that takes effort and is harder to do.</p>\n<p>This course will teach you to not be willpower dependent but willpower enhanced. You will learn to be consistent and develop good habits so your study can be put on autopilot. The system put in place will help you evaluate your problems and overcome them with a process to eliminate procrastination through trained habits.</p>\n<p>Instead of being willpower dependent, we should be willpower enhanced:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We rely on habits which are on autopilot.</li>\n<li>When things get difficult, we try to incorporate better habits and evaluate the process which might need some willpower.</li>\n<li>We don't procrastinate.</li>\n<li>We consistently evaluate our process and try to improve it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These habits need to be trained.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"2rzu5qtc4erc8gkfiteeysj","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1655457392891,"created":1652954242758,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"9a2bd52692d036217559f962a88e54f2","links":[],"anchors":{"welcome-to-dendron":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to Dendron","value":"welcome-to-dendron","line":7,"column":0,"depth":2},"lookup":{"type":"header","text":"Lookup","value":"lookup","line":11,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":["nd2nkpjzc9hp9yhddsgf49w","djmknwf8xylsk3bwbyzgqwa","ygf9ydcqcmf3bdi4wyk3x58","2m3ygofcj8yajjevvh51ask","b9usa34mum3s56s60buxilt","witebak8d2ks87mmo9ofhui","wvvka5dtr8y49ssrhz0ja7d","moclflptspqmdjzdo2mo3x5","omuf127ul29qp4ebuvejtep"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"## Welcome to Dendron\n\nThis is the root of your dendron vault.
