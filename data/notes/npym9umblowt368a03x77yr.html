<p>Spacing is a key concept when it comes to learning. Spacing is practically reviewing the material you have learned after sometime to retain the knowledge.</p>
<p>The key is when and how to space out the material you have learned.</p>
<p>For when, let's take an analogy of plants. Some plants needs more water to grow. Some plants needs less water to grow. This can be similar to the difficulty of different topics. The difficult topics need to be reviewed more often. Just because some plants need more water to grow, does not mean that we will give them all the water. Because, overwatering a single plant continuously on the same day is not a good idea. It is better to space out the watering. The key is to find an optimal watering schedule in which our plants can thrive.</p>
<p>Also, newer memories tend to fade away faster than old memories that we have already recalled and applied multiple times. The reason spacing works is because it mimics the science of decay. Newer memories are forgotten (decay) quickly but reviewing them multiple times makes it harder to forget (increases their time until decay). For something you have learned today, you should review it probably on the same day, then the next, then 3 days later etc.</p>
<p>Something you've known for longer can be spaced out even longer like weeks, months etc.</p>
<p>Because of the above reasons, cramming is a terrible idea for learning and long-term retention.</p>
<p>How to implement spacing?</p>
<ol>
<li>Dissect the material you have learned into digestible pieces that are easy to review. This is done by following the techniques of T-Trees in <a href="/Personal-Knowledge-Vault/notes/dp51cb8fpmnmolb8uayq4yj">Structuring Connections</a>. The leaves of the T-Tree are the pieces of material you need to review.</li>
<li>Create a spacing schedule. This is a list of dates when you need to review the material.</li>
