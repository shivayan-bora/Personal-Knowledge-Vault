<p>Properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Stored remotely: The client doesn't have control over the data on where and how it's stored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asynchronous: It takes a while for the data to arrive from the server to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Owned by many users: A lot of users can interact with the data at the same time and since it's hosted over a server, many users can change the data.
Any data that comes from the server can become outdated in a matter of seconds, so we should treat it with care.</p>
