<p>Our brains are quite incapable of prioritizing tasks on a regular basis for the modern day mostly for medium to long term.</p>
<p>We always prioritize tasks that are urgent and that might not be the best case scenario. e.g. in college and schools we used to get homeworks and they always have a time limit. However, prioritizing homework over quality studying is not always the best case scenatio. In fact, research suggests, too much homework can be harmful to grades.</p>
<p>Something like learning 15 minutes everyday on learning techniques is not something our brain considers urgent, but, that can be very important in the long term as it can save a lot of time and effort.</p>
<p>To combat urgency trapping, we need to schedule things that're important first, rather than the urgent ones.</p>
