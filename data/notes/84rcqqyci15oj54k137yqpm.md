Used for links i.e. linking of one page to another page.

```html
<a href='www.google.com' target='_blank'>Google</a>
```

`href` is the attribute that's used to tell the anchor tag to which link to point to. The value can be put without quotes but in case the link contains spaces, it will break. Hence, it's recommended to put the link inside quotes.

`target='_blank'` will make sure to open the linked page in a new tab.
