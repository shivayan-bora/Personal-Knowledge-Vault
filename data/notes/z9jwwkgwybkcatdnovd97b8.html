<p>The most common way for frontend browsers to communicate with the servers is via HTTP protocol. We generally use fetch or XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with the server over at the frontend natively through JavaScript.</p>
<p>Apart from that we use other JavaScript libraries like jQuery etc. which have their own interfaces like jQueryâ€™s $.ajax() function for the same.</p>
<p>As developers move away from such libraries in favour of native JavaScript, dedicated HTTP clients like Axios emerged to fill the gap.</p>
<p>As with [fetch] and [XMLHttpRequest], Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.</p>
