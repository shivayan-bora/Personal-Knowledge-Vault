When testing any application, you want to be confident that your applications are 100% testing and each of the components is working perfectly.

A tip, when you're looking at any component you need to test, take a step back and think, if I were a manual tester, how would I test this? And then make your tests do the thing that you'd manually test.

## Why should you test?

1. Check whether application behaves as expected.
2. Safeguard against unwated behaviour when changes are made.
3. Automated and thus efficient on the long term.

## What to test?

Have a test priority:

1. High value features.
2. Edge cases in high value features.
3. Things that are easy to break.
