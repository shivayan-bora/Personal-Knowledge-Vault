<h1 id="hsl">Hsl<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#hsl"></a></h1>
<p>The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, is another way to represent colors.</p>
<p>The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.</p>
<p>If you imagine the <a href="/Personal-Knowledge-Vault/notes/hrf8251trbm9ztsj3ki18ik">Colour Wheel</a>, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.</p>
<p>Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.</p>
<p>Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.</p>
