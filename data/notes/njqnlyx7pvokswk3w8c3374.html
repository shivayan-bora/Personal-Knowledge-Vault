<p>The more our tests resmble the way our software is used, the more confidence they'll give.</p>
<p>Utilities are included in this project based on the following guiding principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>If it relates to rendering components, then it should deal with DOM nodes rather than component instances, and it should not encourage dealing with component instances.</li>
<li>It should be generally useful for testing the application components in the way the user would use it. We are making some trade-offs here because we're using a computer and often a simulated browser environment, but in general, utilities should encourage tests that use the components the way they're intended to be used.</li>
<li>Utility implementations and APIs should be simple and flexible.</li>
