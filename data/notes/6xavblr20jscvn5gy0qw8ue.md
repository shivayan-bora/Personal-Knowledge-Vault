1. Alpha Lock: The Alpha lock allows you to only paint on the existing pixels on the current layer and not outside it.
2. Clipping Mask: It works the same as the alpha lock but it creates a new layer on top of the current layer.
3. Masks: Masks creates a new layer on top of the current layer and you can paint black to erase something painted on the current layer and white to reveal something painted on the current layer.
4. Layer Modes: Similar to bnlending modes. Need to dig in more.
