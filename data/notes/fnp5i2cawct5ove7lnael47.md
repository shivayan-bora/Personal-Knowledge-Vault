A block level element, occupies the entire horizontal width of the parent element(container) and vertical space equal to the height of it's contents, thereby creating a 'block'.

Browsers typically display the block-level element with a newline both before and after the element. You can visualize them as a stack of boxes.

**Note**: A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can) i.e. width of the parent.
