CSS Writing Modes is a CSS module that defines various international writing modes, such as left-to-right (e.g. used by Latin and Indic scripts), right-to-left (e.g. used by Hebrew or Arabic scripts), bidirectional (used when mixing left-to-right and right-to-left scripts) and vertical (e.g. used by some Asian scripts).
