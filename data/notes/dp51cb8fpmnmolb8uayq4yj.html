<p>The first step to learning anything new is to make connections or associations between new information and what you already know. This is called learning through association.</p>
<p>Ways of learning through association:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compare and Contrast: Compare the similarities and the differences between concepts.</li>
<li>Part and Whole: Breakdown a big idea into some medium ideas and further break it down in small and basic ideas.</li>
</ol>
<p>To breakdown concepts, we can use the T-Tree framework.

<p>Example: If you take a look at the book of contents of a textbook, the underlying structure might look like this:

<p>When structuring information, the relationship between different ideas i.e. branches/twigs is more important than the details of the ideas i.e. leaves.</p>
<p>The T-Tree framework borrows it's structure from a textbook, however, if you want to have some structure of your own, then use Mind Maps.</p>
<p>To structure your knowledge better, make meaningful notes and try to make it more visual as it's said, <code>a picture is worth a 1000 words</code>.</p>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Structure the information in your own words.</li>
<li>Use less words.</li>
<li>Group ideas together.</li>
<li>Use more pictures and visuals.</li>
<li>Practice.</li>
</ol>
