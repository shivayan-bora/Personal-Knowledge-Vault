<p>When it comes to managing state, people usually prefer a global state management systems like Redux or MobX. These libraries can work, however,they introduce more problems treating the server state the same as the client state and using a global store.</p>
<p>What we need is a library that takes care specifically of the server state, something that handles errors, loads the server state and handles all the server state <a href="/Personal-Knowledge-Vault/notes/fo7ae2wgrgcipwtbhfqag8b">Requirements</a>.</p>
<p> React Query solves all of them - most of them automatically! And even though React Query ships with sensible defaults, pretty much every aspect of how it fetches, stores, and delivers your server state can be configured.</p>
