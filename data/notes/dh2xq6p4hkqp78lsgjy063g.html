<p>Fragments are used in React to group a list of children elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. It's a special kind of component from React which allows you to position two elements side-by-side rather than just nested.</p>
<p>Can be used either as <code>&#x3C;React.Fragment>&#x3C;/React.Fragment></code> or as <code>&#x3C;>&#x3C;/></code>.</p>
