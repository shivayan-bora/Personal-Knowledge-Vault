A network is officially defined as a group or system of interconnected people or items.

Trains stations connected to each other through railway tracks form the railway network.

People who follow each other on Twitter make up an online social network.

Computers connected to each other with cable or wireless radio make up a computer network.

Two main purposes of computer networks:

1. Communication using computers
2. Sharing of resources.

An “internet” allows doing these two things across different computer networks.

The Internet is essentially a network of computer networks.
