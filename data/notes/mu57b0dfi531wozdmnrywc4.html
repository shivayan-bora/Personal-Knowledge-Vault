<p>In React, all the event handlers will be passed an instance of <code>SyntheticEvent</code> which is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native events. It has the same interface as the browser's native event, including <code>stopPropagation()</code> and <code>preventDefault()</code>, except the event works identically across all the browsers. If you want to use the underlying browser event for some reason, you can access it via the <code>nativeEvent</code> attribute. For example in <code>onMouseLeave</code> <code>event.nativeEvent</code> will point to a <code>mouseout</code> event.</p>
<p>This is done for performance reasons and also React does something called as event delegation.</p>
