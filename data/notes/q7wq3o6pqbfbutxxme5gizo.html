<li>Data Persistence</li>
<li>Routes</li>
<li>Data Fetches (Reads)</li>
<li>Data Mutations (Creates, Updates, Deletes)</li>
<li>Rendering Logic</li>

<p>Prisma - ORM for Node.js and TypeScript</p>
<p><code>&#x3C;form></code> only supports GET and POST</p>
<p>MPA => Whatever mutation we do, we have to reload the page and have a history of all the pages we have visited. => Everything on server => Server serves html, css and minimal to no js.</p>
<p>PEMPA => jQuery => jQuery is hard to maintain and is not a good fit for large applications. => jQuery used for DOM manipulation. => Code duplication. => Reandering happens partially in both client and server.</p>
<p>SPA => Rendering everything in client. => Server just stores data. => No rendering happening on servers.</p>
<p>PESPA (Progressively Enhanced SPA) => e.g. Remix, Svelte kit => No more API Routes</p>
<ol>
<li>Functional is the baseline - JS Used to enhance not enable</li>
<li>Lazy Loading - intelligent pre-fetching (more than just JS Code)</li>
<li>Pushes code to the server</li>
<li>No manual duplication of UI code (as in PEMPAs)</li>
<li>Transparent browser emulation (#useThePlatform)</li>
</ol>
<p>Remix makes all network requests and code splitting.</p>
<p>In Review:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transitions involve both frontend and backend</li>
<li>Transitions are primarily about moving where the code lives (where it's written, who writes it and where it's run)</li>
<li>Every transition had motivations</li>
<li>Transtitions can impact UX and DX in both positive and negative ways</li>
<li>Every transition comes with tradeoffs</li>
<li>We are often unaware of the impact of tradeoffs untill after transition</li>
<li>The transition to PESPAs improves both UX and DX</li>
