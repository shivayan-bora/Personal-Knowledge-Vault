1. Make a list and break down the tasks into smaller chunks.
2. Set yourself up for success by removing any kind of distraction and doing things that'll enable us to do the task in hand.
3. Get started on the task beforehand, even for a few minutes, so that it doesn't look very overwhelming when we are actually about to do it.
4. Get a group or a few accountability partners.
5. Aim for a personal best instead of perfection as it's one of the biggest causes of procrastination.
