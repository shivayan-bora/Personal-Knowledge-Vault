One of the best techniques to learn something is Teaching as in this you try to make the other person understand based on your own understanding of a topic which might allow you to find gaps in your own knowledge. Teaching also forces us to package our messy webs of information into something more comprehensible for the other person to understand.

One of the ways to tech is the whole-part-whole technique. First of all, summarize the whole concept. Then dive into the individual parts of the concept and then relate that part with the whole concept to show where it fits.

Another technique is the Feynman Technique:
