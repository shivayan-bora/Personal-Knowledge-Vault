<p>With the power of CSS, we can convert any element to look like any other element. e.g. we can create <code>div</code>'s from a <code>button</code> or a <code>button</code> from a <code>div</code>. Also, we have multiple header elements like <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code> etc. however, any header can be made to look like any other header with CSS. As a matter of fact, we can convert the entire HTML document to just consist of <code>div</code>'s and change the styling to visually make them look like the other elements.</p>
<p>Visually we can see all the different elements and understand what it is, however, it's necessary for our code to understand that too. HTML by nature was meant to define a Semantic structure of the webpage which is used for accessibility purposes. When we use different tags, screen readers and other accessibility readers which might be used by a disabled person, will give them a better User Experience in navigating through the website e.g. <code>h1</code> will them what the website is and different headings will tell them what's important in decreasing level of importance. Similarly, <code>button</code> will them that there's a button there which can be clicked, etc.</p>
