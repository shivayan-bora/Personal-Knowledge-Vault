<h1 id="bold-text">Bold Text<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#bold-text"></a></h1>
<p>Initially, we used to use <code>&#x3C;b>&#x3C;/b></code> tags to make some text bolder. However it has been replaced with <code>&#x3C;strong>&#x3C;/strong></code> as <code>&#x3C;b></code> didn't have any semantic meaning to it.</p>
