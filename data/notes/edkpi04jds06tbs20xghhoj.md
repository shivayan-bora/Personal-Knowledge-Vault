Attributes are pieces of data that we use to describe elements. e.g. Take the following element into consideration:

```html
<img src="laura-jones.jpg" alt="Laura Jones">
```

Here we have an `img` element and we have the following attributes:

1. `src`: Source of the image
2. `alt`: Alternate text in case the image can't be rendered and specifically helpful for accessibility readers. It also enables good SEO as search engines know what this image is all about.
