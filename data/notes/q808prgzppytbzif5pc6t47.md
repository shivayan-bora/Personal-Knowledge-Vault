Properties:

1. Stored remotely: The client doesn't have control over the data on where and how it's stored.

2. Asynchronous: It takes a while for the data to arrive from the server to the client.

3. Owned by many users: A lot of users can interact with the data at the same time and since it's hosted over a server, many users can change the data.
Any data that comes from the server can become outdated in a matter of seconds, so we should treat it with care.
